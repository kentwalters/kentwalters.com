    <h1>Kent Walters</h1>
    <h3>Programmer, Entrepreneur, Soil Scientist</h3>

    <p>I am building <a href="http://sksoilweb.usask.ca/" class="this-text"><i>$this</i></a> at the University of Saskatchewan.</p>
    
    <p>I am building <a href="http://athleteera.ca/" class="this-text"><i>$this</i></a> at Innovation Place.</p>
    
    <p>I built <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1132685496&mt=8" class="this-text"><i>$this</i></a> because soil classification is begging for computation.</p>
    
    <p>I built <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tap2tap/id1104710132?mt=8" class="this-text"><i>$this</i></a> as a school project for CMPT 398 - Mobile Development at the University of Saskatchewan.</p>

    <p>I'm interested in building things for disciplines that haven't traditionally used specialized software to solve problems (read: soil science, physical education).</p>
