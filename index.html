            <h3>Canadian System of Soil Classification iOS App</h3>
            <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/cssc/id1132685496">Link to the app store</a>
            <p>I made this when I barely knew how to program. I had taken a few into CS courses, and having a background in soil science I always wanted to make something like this.</p>
            <p>The code is atrocious, but the app works. It was all a very good learning experience. I'm unsure if I'll ever update it.
                It's written in Objective-C; now I use swift and I probably couldn't stop myself from doing a whole rewrite.</p>

            <h3>Saskatchewan Soil Information System (SKSIS)</h3>
            <a href="https://app.sksis.ca/map">Link to the web app</a>
            <p>I was fortunate enough to be in the right place at the right time when the Department of Soil Science at the University of Saskatchewan received funding to put all of the province's
                soil information online. I had no idea what I was doing when I started this project, but ended up working on it while finishing my CS degree and putting together something decent.</p>

            <h3>Soil Texture Triangle</h3>
            <a href="http://texture-triangle.surge.sh/">Link to the site</a>
            <p>I built this mainly because I wanted to play around with D3.js to potentially use for parts of SKSIS. Texture triangles are kind of interesting though.</p>
            <p>I'd like to update this one to also work on mobile (it relies a lot on cursor position) and to clean up the styling, because it could be a useful tool for someone.</p>

            <h3>TLDS.fun</h3>
            <a href="http://tlds.fun/index.html">Link to the site</a>
            <p>Joke websites need stupid top-level domains. I had navigated to the top-level domains page on Wikipedia one too many times
                and was annoyed by it, so I wanted a site that threw them all at you.</p>
            <p>I ended up being quite lazy with it, and it's not what I envisioned, but I still go to it once in a while to checkout TLD options. </p>
